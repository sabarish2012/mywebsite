                The Murugan temple goes back to 2000 years or so. This is where
                God Muruga had camped before and after his war with the Demon
                king Surapadma. He worshipped God Shiva in this shrine which was
                built by Maya. The native red sandstone rock was used as the
                foundation for the temple and the long Gopuram. The temple’s
                Vasanta Mandap is a recent addition. It has 120 columns and a
                central porch. The 16 pillar Ananda Vilas Mandap stands on a
                raised sandy cliff overlooking the sea. The Shanmukha Vilasam
                houses an ornate mandap with four pillars in the center.

                vaidyanathan, facing towards West whereas East side is the

                (nine planets) temples and is associated with the planet Mars
                (Angaraka).
