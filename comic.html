          DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer
          Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
          Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the
          alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and
          industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story
          features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the
          murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta
          tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and
          intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham
          streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman
          with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl;
          allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as
          the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.

        <h2>CAPTAIN AMERICA</h2>
        <img src="images/captain america.jpeg" alt="CAPTAIN AMERICA" />
        <p>
          Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who
          appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
          character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on
          December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to
          Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steve Rogers, a frail
          man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an
          experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States
          Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an
          American flag-inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield,
          Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with
          the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the
          final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a
          state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He
          resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the
          superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of
          time" to adjust to the new era.
