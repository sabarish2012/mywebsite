      <p>
        Reading" is the process of looking at a series of written symbols and
        getting meaning from them. When we read, we use our eyes to receive
        written symbols (letters, punctuation marks and spaces) and we use our
        brain to convert them into words, sentences and paragraphs that
        communicate something to us.

      <p>
        Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each
        controlling a set of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the
        opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western
        chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese
        chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes
        back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in
        seventh-century India. The rules of chess as they are known today
        emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization
        and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is
        one of the world's most popular games, and is played by millions of
        people worldwide.

      <p>
        Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. A person
        whose profession is singing is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in
        jazz and/or popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives,
        songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical
        instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as
        a choir. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from
        a single instrument (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a
        symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art
        music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Greek music,
        Japanese music, and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional
        music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal, and popular music styles
        such as pop, rock, and electronic dance music.

      <p>
        Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of
        one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools
        or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of
        the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in
        butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
        In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in
        either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four
        swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,
        breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.
