        The KTM 250 Duke is a street bike available in India. Here are some key
        details about it: Engine: It’s powered by a 249.07 cc BS6 Phase 2
        engine. Power and Torque: The engine produces 30.57 bhp of power and 25
        Nm of torque. Features: The 250 Duke comes with a ride-by-wire throttle
        system, a slipper clutch, and a quick shifter. It also has a 5-inch LCD
        display that’s Bluetooth-enabled and offers turn-by-turn navigation.
        Design: The 250 Duke received a significant update in 2024. Its bodywork
        is more similar to the flagship 1290 Super Duke, with a more sinister
        and radical front fascia, muscular fuel tank section, and a new die-cast
        aluminum sub-frame.

      <p>
        The Yamaha R15 V4 gets the 155cc liquid-cooled, SOHC, fuel-injected
        engine that generates 18.4PS @10000rpm and 14.2Nm @7500rpm, paired with
        a 6-speed gearbox. The powertrain uses variable valve actuation (VVA)
        technology to balance good bottom-end grunt and top-end drive. Further,
        the assist and slipper clutch ensures a light lever action

    <h2>HERO XOOM</h2>

      <img src="images/hero xoom.webp" alt="Heroxoom bikes" />
      <p>
        it comes to speed, the Hero Xoom 110 offers a decent performance for a
        scooter in its segment. Let’s take a closer look: The Xoom 110 is
        powered by a 110.9cc BS6 engine that produces 8.05 bhp of power and 8.7
        Nm of torque. While it’s not a high-performance sports bike, it’s
        well-suited for city commuting and short rides. The scooter’s top speed
        is around 85 km/h (kilometers per hour), which is sufficient for most
        urban scenarios. Keep in mind that scooters are designed more for
        efficiency, comfort, and practicality rather than outright speed.

        SOHC, two-valve, air-cooled DTS-i motor. This engine, paired to a
        five-speed constant mesh gearbox, belts out a maximum power output of 12
        bhp at 8,500 rpm along with a peak torque of 11 Nm at 7,000 rpm. The
        suspension duties on the bike are tended to by front telescopic forks
        with Nitrox mono-shock while the breaking duties are tended to by front
        disc brake and rear drum brake. Sarang Kanade, President - Motorcycles,
        Bajaj Auto, said, "We are excited to bring the pedigree of the higher cc
        Pulsar NS series bikes, for first-time performance riding enthusiasts.
